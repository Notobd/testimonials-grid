### What I learned

Learnt how to use the grid layout for the first time and felt comforatble using it and also dabbled into positioning for the first time and got assistance from a mentor.

```css
#patTestimonial {
  grid-column: 2 / span 2;
  grid-row: 2;
}
```

```css
.quote-container {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 10;
  left: 130px;
}
```

### Continued development

practice with more tasks that have to do with grid to better understand it.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_grid_item](https://www.example.com) - This really helped me how to set grid layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
